## Course Work

Here are the iOS Development courses and programs that I have taken.

### iOS 11 & Swift 4 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (2018)
#### Dr. Angela Yu - Udemy

This course kickstarted my interest in Swift development and gave me enough experience to build [my first app](portfolio/Switch-Shoutout.md). Dr. Angela Yu is a gifted and easy-to-understand instructor, and I would recommend her courses to anyone looking to learn Swift.

### Swift Coding and App Development Certificate Program (2021/2022)
#### The Ohio State University
[Topics covered](course-work/osu-coding-curriculum.md)

Through their partnership with Apple, The Ohio State University created a Swift development curriculum that teaches the core concepts of iOS development.

### 100 Days of SwiftUI (2023)
#### Hacking With Swift
[Certificate of completion](https://github.com/brianeatsbeets/brianeatsbeets.github.io/assets/94752449/e9f5e13e-854c-4181-a437-dd3502b543bf)

This course was a very comprehensive and well-written resource for learning the ins and outs of SwiftUI. As SwiftUI continues to be built out with new features and support, I have no doubt that it will become an integral framework for most iOS developers.
