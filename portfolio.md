## My Work

Here are some of the project highlights from my Swift development experience.

### [Switch Shoutout](Switch-Shoutout.md)

Switch Shoutout is a companion app for the Nintendo Switch that allows users to notify friends of games they were playing, add their game library, and chat with friends.

### [FooDisc](FooDisc.md)

FooDisc is a personal replication of UDisc to test out new ideas and features for future projects.
