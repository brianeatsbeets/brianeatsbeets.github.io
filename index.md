## Something about me

Hi! My name's Brian. I'm an iOS developer.

After spending nearly a decade working in IT (and web development on top of that over the past few years), I have committed myself to seeking a new career path in mobile development. From the first time I took an introductory course to Swift back when it was version 3, I felt a strong sense of belonging and excitement that I hadn't found in my day job for several years. I am looking to commit my passion and development experience to an organization that takes pride in its work and doesn't gloss over the fine-grained details of the user experience.
