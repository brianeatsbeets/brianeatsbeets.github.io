DiscDrawer is a disc golf disc inventory app written in SwiftUI. In its current state, you can add discs to your collection, look up information on discs you don't own, and measure/track your throw distances. This is an ongoing project that I have been developing while working through the 100 Days of SwiftUI course. 

Features:
- Built in SwiftUI
- Persistence via Core Data
- Photo capture via UIViewControllerRepresentable
- MapKit integration to measure throw distances
- Custom splash screen animation
- Custom list filter picker
