DiscFlip was initially created to be an easy way for me to track and maintain records of disc sales and expenditures, but is evolving into a more generic book-keeping app. This will allow it to break out of a niche market and serve as a straight-forward record-keeping utility for casual buyers and sellers who don't want to mess with complicated, pricey bookkeeping software.

This project incorporates a variety of UIKit interactible elements and utilizes stack views and both static and dynamic table views. There are also some small animations to provide a fun, visual pop to certain user interactions.

Other features:
- Colored theme and styling
- Standard and Keyframe animations
- Local data storage & persistence
- Diffable data sources
- Input field validation
- Dynamic unwind navigation flow based on context
- Filterable table view with multiple filter input sources
- Custom enlarged button "hitbox" to adhere to Human Interface Guidelines
