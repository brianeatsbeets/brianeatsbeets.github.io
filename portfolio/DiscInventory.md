This app was initially created to test out a simple disc inventory utility that would later be integrated into the FooDisc app. It is comprised of two table view controllers (one dynamic, one static) and utilizes local storage and persistence.

It is has been recently updated with an MVVM architecture, and it contains a small suite of unit tests.
