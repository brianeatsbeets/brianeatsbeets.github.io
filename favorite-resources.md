## Favorite Resources

Here are some of the books, websites, and other iOS development resources that I've enjoyed.

### Books
- [Develop in Swift Fundamentals](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-fundamentals/id1556365994)
  - I worked through this book as part of the [OSU Swift Coding and App Development Certificate Program](course-work/osu-coding-curriculum.md). Apple does a great job of explaining the basics of Swift in an easy-to-understand way, and the built-in quizzes and projects are well-thought-out in applying the concepts covered. Highly recommended for beginners.
- [Develop in Swift Data Collections](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-data-collections/id1581183203)
  - Same as above; just the next book in the series.
- [SwiftUI for Masterminds, 3rd Edition](https://www.formasterminds.com/swiftui_for_masterminds_3rd_edition/)
  - I'm currently reading through this book to build my foundational knowledge of SwiftUI, but it is an extremely thorough and outstanding resource for the Swift language as a whole! This was recommended to me by an acquaintance and it has not disappointed. If you've been building your Swift knowledge by going from online tutorial to online tutorial, you're missing out on the wide foundation a book like this provides.

### Websites
- [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/)
  - A straight-forward, easy-to-read weekly newsletter provided by an expert in the industry (and also the creator of the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/)!). The insights provided throughout the newsletter are unique and informative, and I feel like I learn something new with each issue.
- [Kodeco](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) (formerly Ray Wenderlich)
  - If you're looking for tutorials, look no further. The number of topics covered on this site are innumerable, and they're all written in a fun and friendly way. Occasionally there will be supporting APIs or concepts used in a tutorial that are a bit more advanced, and it would be nice if they would include some additional resources or explanations for those. But overall, these step-by-step guides are a great tool to keep on your short list.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
  - A huge repository for all sorts of classes. I took Dr. Angela Yu's Swift and iOS Bootcamp back in 2017, and she does a fantastic job at explaining development concepts in an easy-to-understand way. I highly recommend checking out her offerings [here](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/).
- [Cocoacasts](https://cocoacasts.com/)
  - I don't have a paid subscription to this site, but the free articles and explanations are thorough and easy to grasp. If I ever spot this site when Googling a Swift concept, it will usually be the first or second one I click on.
- [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation)
  - A key resource for any Apple developer. Sometimes I have to do some additional research to figure out how to implement a new function or concept, but this is a good one to have bookmarked. Potentially the best part is that most, if not all, of this information is available via Xcode's built-in documentation guide, which is just an Option+Click away.
- [Apple WWDC Conference](https://developer.apple.com/videos/)
  - I don't always catch these live, but it's always a fun dive watching through the WWDC conferences, especially the numerous sessions on individual new features. A great way to stay in-the-know on all of the new Apple development updates.
