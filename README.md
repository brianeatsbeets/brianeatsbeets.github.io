## Something about me

Hi! My name's Brian. I'm an iOS developer-in-training with aspirations to become a full-time Swift developer. I've taken some Swift development courses in previous years as a curiosity indulgance, but after committing to challenge myself and seek a new career path, I decided to work through the Swift Coding Curriculum offered by The Ohio State University Digital Flagship Program. My goal is to complete this course, refine my skills while building a portfolio, and begin working as a professional iOS developer.

Most of the course so far has been a review of concepts that I am already familiar with, but it's been very interesting to see the changes to the Swift languange since version 3. I've come across many useful features that have been introduced, such as computed properties and property observers. I'm looking forward to continue re-familiarizing myself with the language and build upon what I've already learned.
