## Something about me

Hi! My name's Brian. I'm an iOS developer-in-training with aspirations to become a full-time Swift developer. I've taken some Swift development courses in previous years as a curiosity indulgance, but after committing to challenge myself and seek a new career path, I decided to work through the Swift Coding Curriculum offered by The Ohio State University Digital Flagship Program. My goal is to complete this course, refine my skills while building a portfolio, and begin working as a professional iOS developer.
